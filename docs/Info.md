## Communication between browser and node without nodeIntegration

* https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5113#issuecomment-208713736
* https://electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-renderer
> When you spawn your browser window set the preload option to a script you wish to preload:
> 
> ```js
> webPreferences: {
>     nodeIntegration: false,
>     preload: "preload.js"
> }
> ```
> 
> Then in the preload script put in `window.ipc = require('ipc')`. Do your IPC communication in the preload.js and have the code interact with your browser window as if it was loaded using script tags.
